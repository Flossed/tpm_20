## üìñ **User Story Template Enhancements**

### **ZANDD HSM User Personas & Examples**
- **Security Administrator**: Create TPM-backed vaults with hardware-level protection
- **Developer**: Generate ECDSA P-256 keys with maximum cryptographic security
- **Certificate Manager**: Generate CSRs from stored keys for ZANDD CA signing
- **System Operator**: Validate certificate chains for authenticity verification

### **Enhanced Acceptance Criteria Examples**
```gherkin
Scenario 1: Vault Creation with TPM
Given I am on the ZANDD HSM Manager main screen
When I click "Create New Vault" 
Then I should see a vault creation dialog with TPM status
And the system should generate TPM entropy for vault encryption
And the vault should show as "TPM-backed" in the status

Scenario 2: Key Generation with Hardware Entropy
Given I have selected an active vault
When I click "Generate New Key"
Then I should see key creation options (ECDSA P-256, RSA, etc.)
And the system should use TPM entropy for key generation  
And the key should be stored encrypted in the vault
```

### **Technical Implementation Guidance**
- **TPM Integration**: Microsoft Platform Crypto Provider usage
- **Security Requirements**: Administrator privileges, hardware entropy validation
- **Performance Targets**: <100ms operations, 145 ops/sec capability
- **Architecture Patterns**: WPF/MVVM, REST API design, vault encryption

Vault Encryption:
  - Use .NET AesGcm class with PBKDF2 key derivation (SHA-256, 100k iterations)
  - Store salt, IV, and authentication tag with encrypted data
  - Implement secure memory wiping after operations

UI Development:
  - Create WPF UserControls with MVVM pattern

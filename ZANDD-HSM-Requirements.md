# ZANDD HSM Project Requirements
**Enterprise TPM-Backed Hardware Security Module**

---

## üéØ **Project Vision**
Create an enterprise-grade Hardware Security Module (HSM) using TPM 2.0 as the Hardware Root of Trust, with a clean separation between TPM initialization services and HSM operational services.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **Repository Structure:**
```
ZANDD-HSM/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tpm-service/          # TPM initialization & management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hsm-service/          # HSM API & operations  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/               # Common libraries & utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                 # Documentation & specifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/             # Usage examples & SDKs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                # Test suites & integration tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/           # Docker, K8s, and deployment configs
```

### **Component Separation:**

#### **TPM Service** *(Admin Required - Setup Only)*
- **Purpose:** TPM hardware initialization and root of trust establishment
- **Privileges:** Requires Administrator privileges for TPM hardware access
- **Usage:** One-time setup and maintenance operations
- **Responsibilities:**
  - TPM hardware detection & initialization
  - TPM primary key creation (Hardware Root of Trust)
  - TPM key wrapping/unwrapping operations
  - HSM vault initialization and encryption
  - System health checks & TPM status monitoring
  - Hardware attestation and integrity verification

#### **HSM Service** *(No Admin Required - Daily Operations)*
- **Purpose:** Enterprise cryptographic operations and key management
- **Privileges:** Standard user privileges sufficient
- **Usage:** 24/7 production service for cryptographic operations
- **Responsibilities:**
  - RESTful API for key management operations
  - Key generation (RSA, ECDSA, AES, symmetric keys)

## üîê **Security Architecture**

### **TPM Root of Trust Model:**
1. **TPM Primary Key** 
   - Hardware-backed master key, never leaves TPM chip
   - Used exclusively for key wrapping/unwrapping operations
   - Provides cryptographic proof of hardware integrity

2. **Key Wrapping Strategy**
   - All HSM keys encrypted using TPM primary key
   - AES-256-GCM encryption with authenticated encryption
   - Key derivation using PBKDF2 with hardware-backed salt

3. **Unsealing & Attestation**
   - TPM validates system integrity before key access
   - Hardware-based attestation prevents key access on compromised systems
   - Boot integrity measurement and verification

4. **Hardware Binding**
   - Keys cryptographically tied to specific TPM/hardware combination
   - Prevents key migration to unauthorized systems
   - Hardware failure recovery through secure backup/restore procedures
